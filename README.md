Blockchain with Flask
=======================

### What is blockchain?

A blockchain â€“  is a continuously growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography hash. Each block typically contains a hash pointer as a link to a previous block and a timestamp. By design, blockchains are inherently resistant to modification of the data. For getting hash mostly using SHA-256.

A proof of work is a piece of data which is difficult (costly, time-consuming) to produce but easy for others to verify and which satisfies certain requirements. Producing a proof of work can be a random process with low probability so that a lot of trial and error is required on average before a valid proof of work is generated. Bitcoin uses the Hashcash proof of work system.
